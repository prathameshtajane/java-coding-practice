/**
 * This problem was asked by google.

 Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k.
 If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.

 Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

 For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums up to 24.
